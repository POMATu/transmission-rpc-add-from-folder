some strange app that i needed for my data hoarder project

app watches spool directory for new torrents, then checks if torrent has specific file extensions init and uploads torrent to transmission-web where it starts downloading


app arguments:
- path to config.ini file

check reference config.ini in project folder

project is made in visual studio 2015 and targetted for .net 4.6.1
